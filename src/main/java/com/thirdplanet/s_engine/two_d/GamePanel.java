/**
 * A core technology for a good game is an animation
 * algorithm that produces reliably fast game play
 * across various operating systems(e.g. flavors of Widows, Linux an d
 * OSX)...and in different types of jvm based programs, applets
 * , windoewd , and full-scrren applications).
 *
 * GamePanel is a JPanel subclass witch acts as a 2D canvas
 * for drawing 2D graphics(lines, circles, text, images).
 *
 * Animation is managed by a thread, which ensures that it
 * it progresses at a fairly consistent rate(FPS), where a frame
 * corresponds to a sinle rendering of the application canvas.
 *
 * {update, render, sleep} animation loop
 *
 * -Starting and terminating an animation
 * -double buffering
 * -user interaction
 * -active rendering
 * -andimation control based on a user's requested FPS
 * -management of inaccuracies in the timer and sleep operations
 * -Combining FPS and game state updates per seconds(UPS)
 * -Game pausing and resumption
 *
 * Threads:  We have two main ones here
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * 1. Main thread(GUI, events)
 * 2. animator thread(updates and rendering)
 * JMM deals with this via forcing atomicity on all
 * variables save for longs and doubles.
 * 3. Set variables whom state is globally important to volatile
 * so that their currently extant values may not be copied to local
 * thread memory.
 *
 *
 * Why are making the animation thread sleep for a few "moments ?
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * We want to give the jvm time to garbage collect....or rather
 * ensure that the jvm will garbage collect....otherwise there is
 * a real possiblity that our animation thread will hog up most of the
 * CPU time(I am guessing...need more infor on how the jvm does things
 * these days..)
 *
 * We also want to give the preceding call to repaint() time to finish...
 * everytime we call repaint()  the request is placed on the jvm's
 * event queue and then returns.  When this request is completed is
 * not up to us....
 *
 * The repaint request will be processed, precolating down
 * through the components of the application until
 * GamePanel's paintComponent() is called....so is 20 ms to
 * generous ?  Maybe it's just right...as it also prevents event
 * coalescence...where a jvm overloaded with events may drop some...
 * bad juju.....

         * Even with the most exciting game, there comes a a time

         *
         * One largely discredited coding appraoch is to use
         * Thread.suspend() and resume.  these methods are deprecated
         * for a similar reason to Thread.stop(); suspend() can
         * cause applet/application to suspend at any point in its
         * execution.  Tis can easily lead to deadlock...as the thread
         * is holding a resource since it will be releasedunilt the
         * thread resumes.
         *
         * Instead, use Thread.wait() ; and Thread.notify to implement
         * puase and resume functionality.  The idea here is to suspend the
         * animation thread, but the event dispatcher thread will still
         * respond to GUI activity.
         *
         * Though the elements of the game seen by the user
         * can pause, it is often useful for the other parts
         * to contine executiong.  For example, in a network
         * game, it may be necessary to monitor sockets for
         * messages comming from other players....
         *
         * Key presses are still handled by  the KeyListener method
         * since it must be possible to quit even in the paused state....
         *
         *
         * We don't want isPaused() to be monitored in the run() method
         * since the animation thread doesn't suspend.  isPaused() is
         * used to switch off testPress() and gameUpdate()
